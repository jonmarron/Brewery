Brewery

Breweries produce different types of beer grouped into two main classes: lager and ale.

All beers have their own qualities:
Strength level calculated based on their alcohol content
0-3%: light
3-6%: medium
6%+: strong
Name

The brewery has records of its recent stock and lets customers check if they have the required amount based on the name of the beer (like “I would like to buy 127 Guinness”).

Breweries have their master brewer and helpers. Each person working at a Brewery has a name and their years of experience. Helpers are working just some of the days (e.g. “worker1 works just on Monday and Friday”) while the master works day and night!

Master can be asked to brew X amount of beer on Y day. He can only brew as many pieces of beer as the number of helpers that day.
